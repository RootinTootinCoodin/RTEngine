RT Engine

That's what I call a rootin' tootin' engine, partner!

RT Engine is a game engine developed in C++ using OpenGL. It is developed by Joel Cabaco Pérez and Lorién Portella López, both students of the Bachelor's Degree in Videogame Design and Development at CITM, a UPC center.

You can see the source code of the engine in our Github repository, here:
